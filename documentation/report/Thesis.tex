	I, Pierre-Amaury GRUMIAUX, declare that this report titled, `Physical modelling synthesis in Faust' and the work presented in it are my own. I confirm that:

	\begin{itemize} 
	\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] This work was done wholly or mainly while an second-year internship as part of my engineering curriculum.
 
	\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] Where I have consulted the published work of others, this is always clearly attributed.
 
	\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] Where I have quoted from the work of others, the source is always given. With the exception of such quotations, this report is entirely my own work.

This report is an explanation guide of what was done during my second-year internship. It is divided into three parts.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Part 1 is a presentation of the company where the internship took place, who they are, what they do, and what is the project I took part in.
    \item The technical review of the mission of the internship, written as clear as possible for the reader, is itself divided into three parts :
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A quick review of what physical modeling synthesis is;
        \item Presentation of Faust, a functional programming language for implementing signal processing blocks, with some elements to understand how it works.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The description of what was produced during the internship : \texttt{pm.lib} (a Faust library), \texttt{IR2dsp.py} (a python script to generate a modal model in Faust from an impulse response), and \texttt{mesh2dsp.py} (a python script to generate a modal model based on FEM analysis).
    \item Finally, I provide an assessment of the internship, and of what can be done in future work.
\end{enumerate}

First, I would like to thank Pierre Jouvelot and Emilio Jes√∫s Gallego Arias who allowed me to do my second-year internship at the Centre de recherche en informatique at MINES ParisTech. They also gave me the opportunity to choose the topic of my internship, and I thank them a lot for that, as it is a part of my career plan. They were really pleasant during my internship, and also helpful when I needed some advice. \par

Next, I would like to thank Romain Michon from the CCRMA at Stanford University, without whom the topic of the internship would not have been proposed to me. He provided me a lot of advice and directions for my work, and took a part in the review of it, although the time difference was not our ally. \par

I would also like to thank all the people involved in the Feever project, of which my work is a part, as well as each member of the Centre de recherche en informatique with whom I shared some time during my internship.

I thank the administration of MINES ParisTech for providing me an accommodation during those three months of internship, which was a privilege.

Finally, I thank all the people with whom I shared some moments during this internship, my co-workers at MINES ParisTech, my kins and my friends.
